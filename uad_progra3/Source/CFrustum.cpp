There are different ways to compute the frustum information. 

  + A geometric approach takes the camera position and lookAt vectors, as well as the near and far planes and the fov and aspect ratio.
    The frustum points in world space are computed as a function of these variables.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The apex of the pyramid is the position of the camera (px,py,pz). A view ray can be computed with direction d = l - p, where l = (lx,ly,lz) and origin p = (px,py,pz). 
	The near and far planes are perpendicular to the view ray and are placed at distances nearDist and farDist. 
	The rectangular boundaries of the view frustum in those planes, near and far, have dimensions that are a function of the distance and the fov (vertical field of view), 
	and ratio (ratio between the horizontal and vertical fields of view).
	
	The height and width of the rectangular boundary on the near plane are defined as follows:

	Hnear = 2 * tan(fov / 2) * nearDist
	Wnear = Hnear * ratio

	The same reasoning can be applied to the far plane:

	Hfar = 2 * tan(fov / 2) * farDist
	Wfar = Hfar * ratio

	The planes are defined such that the normal points towards the inside of the view frustum. Testing if an object is inside the view frustum is performed 
	by computing on which side of the plane the object resides. This can be done computing the signed distance from the point ot the plane. 
	If it is on the side that the normal is pointing, i.e. the signed distance is positive, then it is on the right side of the respective plane. 
	If an object is on the right side of all six planes then the object is inside the frustum.

  + Another approach is to compute the frustum using the projection matrix and the inverse of the movelview matrix.

	The easiest way I know of is to construct the view frustum in post-projective space (so-called NDC space), where the frustum is a cube,
	then transform it through the inverse view-projection matrix and construct the planes in world space.

	The frustum in NDC space runs from -1 to +1 along the x and y axes, and from -1 to +1 on z if you're in OpenGL, or 0 to 1 on z if you're in D3D. 
	Build the eight corners of this cube (setting w = 1), then multiply them by the inverse view-projection matrix, and divide by w to convert back to regular 3D points.

	The result should be the frustum corners in world space, and you can then build the planes by using groups of 3 points and the usual formula for calculating a plane equation from 3 points.

	This general technique should work with any kind of view-projection matrix - perspective or orthographic, oblique or straight, any FoV or aspect ratio, etc. There are ways to simplify it by making 
	some assumptions about the form of the matrix, but those tend to break if any of the assumptions are changed.
